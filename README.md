Bare-metal programming for the SMT32 Microcontrollers using the HAL library

## Summary
Course work associated with the Udemy.com course "Embedded Systems STM32 HAL APIs Driver Development" , authored by Israel Gbati.

* The most of the source code examples are coded for the the specifics of  Nucleo F429ZI (registries and pins configuration). 
* Other examples apply to the STM32F429I_DISCOVERY1 board (registries and pins configuration). 

In most of the cases, I have specified the target board in the heading of source code files.
